# Daily Standup Notes Generator

Generate daily standup notes for the **Activation** and **Append** squads by gathering yesterday's activity from multiple sources and updating the team's Confluence standup pages.

## What It Does

1. Checks connectivity to all required services (Confluence, Jira, Slack, PagerDuty, GitHub)
2. **Mandatory PTO/OOO check** — searches Slack and Confluence for time-off signals before composing notes
3. For each engineer in the target squad(s), gathers yesterday's activity from:
   - **Jira** — ticket details, worklogs, descriptions (uses actual ticket titles, not paraphrased)
   - **GitHub** — PRs opened/reviewed/merged, commits
   - **Slack** — messages in channels and group DMs (excludes 1-on-1 DMs)
   - **Confluence** — pages edited
   - **PagerDuty** — incidents triggered/acknowledged/resolved
4. Generates work-focused bullet-point summaries (max 5 bullets, 40 words each) describing what was actually built, fixed, tested, or documented
5. Links all Jira ticket keys as hyperlinks
6. Displays the generated notes for review (does not write to Confluence)

## Usage

```
/standup-notes                      # Generate for both squads
/standup-notes activation           # Activation squad only
/standup-notes append               # Append squad only
/standup-notes Jonathan Hudson      # Single engineer from a configured squad
/standup-notes Kapil Shrivastava    # Any engineer (ad-hoc, no squad needed)
```

## Squads

### Activation Squad
- **Engineers**: Mike Brant, Nathan Conroy
- **Page**: [Activation Daily Standup](https://resonate-jira.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/5989793812)
- **Format**: Child pages per sprint, daily tables with @mentions

### Append Squad
- **Engineers**: Jonathan Hudson, Sayali Patwardhan, Joe Xu
- **Page**: [Append Daily Scrum Notes](https://resonate-jira.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/folder/5472681995) (parent folder)
- **Format**: Child pages per sprint (e.g., `Sprint 390 Append Daily Scrum Note`), daily tables with @mentions

## Template Per Engineer

```
Full Name of Engineer
Yesterday:
- <work-focused summary from Jira, GitHub, Slack, Confluence>
Today:
PostScrum:
Pagerduty:
- <auto-generated from PagerDuty if applicable, otherwise blank>
```

## Key Rules

- **Work-focused bullets** — describe what was done, not Jira status transitions
- **Verbatim ticket titles** — never paraphrase Jira ticket summaries
- **Include time logged** — show hours when worklog data is available
- **One work item per bullet** — never combine separate tickets into one bullet
- **Ticket hyperlinks** — all ticket keys link to Jira browse URLs
- **PTO/OOO gating** — must complete PTO check before composing any notes
- **No 1-on-1 DMs** — only channel and group DM messages are reported
- **Single-engineer mode** — provide an engineer's name to generate only their report; cross-squad tickets are included
- **Ad-hoc username** — any engineer can generate their own report, even if not in a configured squad
- **Display only** — notes are shown for review, not written to Confluence automatically

## Prerequisites

| Service | Required | How to Connect |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Atlassian (Jira + Confluence) | Yes | `/plugin install atlassian@claude-plugins-official` |
| Slack | Yes | Connect via Claude Code settings |
| PagerDuty | Yes | Configure pagerduty MCP server |
| GitHub | Yes | `gh auth login` |

Run `./scripts/de-plugins check standup-notes` to verify all prerequisites.

## Error Handling

- If any service is unreachable, the skill reports the error and stops
- No workarounds are attempted — the user is asked to fix connectivity
