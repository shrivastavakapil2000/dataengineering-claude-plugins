# Daily Standup Notes Generator

Generate daily standup notes for the **Activation** and **DaaS** squads by gathering yesterday's activity from multiple sources and updating the team's Confluence standup pages.

## What It Does

1. Checks connectivity to all required services (Confluence, Jira, Slack, PagerDuty, GitHub)
2. **Mandatory PTO/OOO check** — searches Slack and Confluence for time-off signals before composing notes
3. For each engineer in the target squad(s), gathers yesterday's activity from:
   - **Jira** — ticket details, worklogs, descriptions (uses actual ticket titles, not paraphrased)
   - **GitHub** — PRs opened/reviewed/merged, commits
   - **Slack** — messages in channels and group DMs (excludes 1-on-1 DMs)
   - **Confluence** — pages edited
   - **PagerDuty** — incidents triggered/acknowledged/resolved
4. Generates work-focused bullet-point summaries (max 5 bullets, 40 words each) describing what was actually built, fixed, tested, or documented
5. Links all Jira ticket keys as hyperlinks
6. Updates the Confluence standup page with today's section

## Usage

```
/standup-notes              # Generate for both squads
/standup-notes activation   # Activation squad only
/standup-notes daas         # DaaS squad only
```

## Squads

### Activation Squad
- **Engineers**: Mike Brant, Nathan Conroy
- **Page**: [Activation Daily Standup](https://resonate-jira.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/5989793812)
- **Format**: Child pages per sprint, daily tables with @mentions

### DaaS Squad
- **Engineers**: Jonathan Hudson, Sayali Patwardhan, Joe Xu
- **Page**: [DaaS Squad - Daily Scrum Notes 2026 Q1 Q2](https://resonate-jira.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/6602752005)
- **Format**: Single page with sprint sections, daily tables with full names

## Template Per Engineer

```
Full Name of Engineer
Yesterday:
- <work-focused summary from Jira, GitHub, Slack, Confluence>
Today:
PostScrum:
Pagerduty:
- <auto-generated from PagerDuty if applicable, otherwise blank>
```

## Key Rules

- **Work-focused bullets** — describe what was done, not Jira status transitions
- **Verbatim ticket titles** — never paraphrase Jira ticket summaries
- **Include time logged** — show hours when worklog data is available
- **One work item per bullet** — never combine separate tickets into one bullet
- **Ticket hyperlinks** — all ticket keys link to Jira browse URLs
- **PTO/OOO gating** — must complete PTO check before composing any notes
- **No 1-on-1 DMs** — only channel and group DM messages are reported

## Prerequisites

| Service | Required | How to Connect |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Atlassian (Jira + Confluence) | Yes | `/plugin install atlassian@claude-plugins-official` |
| Slack | Yes | Connect via Claude Code settings |
| PagerDuty | Yes | Configure pagerduty MCP server |
| GitHub | Yes | `gh auth login` |

Run `./scripts/de-plugins check standup-notes` to verify all prerequisites.

## Error Handling

- If any service is unreachable, the skill reports the error and stops
- No workarounds are attempted — the user is asked to fix connectivity
- If today's section already exists, the skill skips that squad to avoid duplicates
