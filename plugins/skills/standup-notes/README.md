# Daily Standup Notes Generator

Generate daily standup notes for the **Activation** and **DaaS** squads by gathering yesterday's activity from multiple sources and updating the team's Confluence standup pages.

## What It Does

1. Checks connectivity to all required services (Confluence, Jira, Slack, PagerDuty, GitHub)
2. For each engineer in the target squad(s), gathers yesterday's activity from:
   - **Jira** — issues updated, status changes, comments
   - **GitHub** — PRs opened/reviewed/merged, commits
   - **Slack** — messages in team channels
   - **Confluence** — pages edited
   - **PagerDuty** — incidents triggered/acknowledged/resolved
3. Generates concise bullet-point summaries (max 5 bullets, 12 words each)
4. Updates the Confluence standup page with today's section

## Usage

```
/standup-notes              # Generate for both squads
/standup-notes activation   # Activation squad only
/standup-notes daas         # DaaS squad only
```

## Prerequisites

| Service | Required | How to Connect |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Atlassian (Jira + Confluence) | Yes | `/plugin install atlassian@claude-plugins-official` |
| Slack | Yes | Connect via Claude Code settings |
| PagerDuty | Yes | Configure pagerduty MCP server |
| GitHub | Yes | `gh auth login` |

Run `./scripts/de-plugins check standup-notes` to verify all prerequisites.

## Error Handling

- If any service is unreachable, the skill reports the error and stops
- No workarounds are attempted — the user is asked to fix connectivity
- If today's section already exists, the skill skips that squad to avoid duplicates
