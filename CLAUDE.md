# CLAUDE.md — Data Engineering Claude Plugins

## Project Overview
Repository for Claude Code plugins, MCP servers, custom commands, and configuration used by the Data Engineering team at Resonate.

## Repository Structure
```
.claude/
  commands/       # Custom slash commands for common workflows
  settings.json   # Project-level Claude Code settings
CLAUDE.md         # This file — project instructions for Claude Code
```

## Conventions
- All MCP server configs should include a README explaining setup and usage
- Custom commands go in `.claude/commands/` as markdown files
- Keep plugin code modular — one directory per plugin/server
- Include tests for any MCP server tools

## MCP Servers
_Add MCP server directories here as they are developed._

## Plugins
_Add plugin directories here as they are developed._
